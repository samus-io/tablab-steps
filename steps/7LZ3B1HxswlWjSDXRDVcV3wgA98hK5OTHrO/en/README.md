# Information disclosure via backup files

* Backup files containing sensitive data may lead to information disclosure if they are unintentionally exposed on web applications without sufficient access restrictions. When exposed, these files may hold sensitive information such as database credentials, configuration details, or source code, making them a prime target for attackers.
* These files may be automatically generated by backup systems or manually created by developers and administrators, often in urgent situations requiring a hotfix to address a system failure or security vulnerability.
  * Furthermore, storing them in predictable locations like `/backup` directories raises the risk of unauthorized access.
* File extensions like `.bak`, `.zip`, `.tar`, and `.old` are frequently used for backups, which malicious users might specifically search for.

## Potential threats caused by information disclosure through backup files

* Backup archives often store configuration details, database records, or authentication keys, which can be exploited to further compromise systems. If an attacker accesses a backup file, they can examine its contents, including source code or credentials, to detect and exploit additional vulnerabilities.
* Unintentional exposure of backup files can create other significant security risks, including the compromise of sensitive data confidentiality and breaches of privacy. In some cases, unauthorized access to backup archives may lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations, subjecting organizations to legal and financial repercussions.

## Methods for identifying exposed backup files

* When the presence of backup files on an instance is unclear, specific commands can help in locating them:
  * In Linux, the `find` command can be used to search within the root of the web directory:

    ```bash
    find . -type f -regex ".*\.\(bak\|txt\|src\|dev\|old\|inc\|orig\|copy\|tmp\)$"
    ```

  * In Windows, the `cmd.exe` command can scan for common backup file extensions:

    ```cmd
    dir *.bak *.txt *.src *.dev *.old *.inc *.orig *.copy *.tmp /s /b
    ```

  * Additionally, `PowerShell` provides an alternative method for identifying backup files across directories:

    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "\.(bak|txt|src|dev|old|inc|orig|copy|tmp)$" }
    ```

* Publicly accessible backup files may also be indexed by search engines, making them easy targets for malicious users. Google Dorking, a technique that leverages advanced search operators to find publicly accessible information, can be used to identify exposed backup files:
  * Searching for common backup file extensions within a specific domain:

    ```plaintext
    site:example.tbl filetype:bak OR filetype:zip OR filetype:tar OR filetype:old
    ```

  * Identifying publicly accessible backup directories within a specific domain:

    ```plaintext
    site:example.tbl inurl:/backup/ OR intitle:"index of /backup"
    ```

* Regular scans for these files assist in detecting exposed backups and applying appropriate security actions.

## Recommended security approaches

* **Storing backups on dedicated backup services or isolated infrastructure** minimizes accidental exposure by ensuring they're kept away from exposed environments.
* **Strict access permission management** reduces exposure risks, specifically by adhering to the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized users to access backup files.
* **Protecting backups with encryption** guarantees that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains protected and unreadable.

## Finding hidden files using brute-force

* `wfuzz` is a powerful tool used to brute-force file and directory names in web applications, helping uncover hidden or unlinked resources.
* The following command uses `wfuzz` to brute-force potential hidden files or directories at a specified URL:

  ```bash
  wfuzz -c -w common.txt --hc 404 <url>/FUZZ
  ```

  * `-c`: shows the output with colors.
  * `-w`: specifies the wordlist (`common.txt`) containing potential file or directory names to try.
  * `--hc 404`: hides responses that return a 404 HTTP status code (Not Found), focusing on potentially valid paths.
  * `<url>/FUZZ`: The target URL where `FUZZ` is a placeholder that `wfuzz` will replace with each entry from the wordlist.
* In summary, this command attempts to discover valid endpoints on a web server by replacing `FUZZ` in the URL with entries from `common.txt`, ignoring any responses that return a 404 error.

## Exercise to practice :writing_hand:

* The following web application has an exposed backup file that it is public accessible.
* The goal of this exercise is to find the backup file using `wfuzz` by brute-forcing the web application.
* An environment variable named `$APP_URL` stores the application's base URL, which can be used to send requests.
* There is a wordlist in the `tbl` user's home directory that can be used with `wfuzz` tool.
* After finding the backup file, the exercise will be completed automatically.
