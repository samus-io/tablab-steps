# User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

* The most distinctive feature of `User Acceptance Testing` (UAT in short) is its direct engagement with real-world users.
* Its main focus is ensuring the application meets the expectations and requirements of end users before releasing it into production.
* UATs give the last green light for deployment, giving the team confidence and helping identify issues that might not rise in earlier testing phases, specially related to user behavior and habits.
* They place user-centric validation at the core of their mission; breaking down user flows into a series of steps and meticulously scrutinizing them. Focusing on **what the software should do, and not how** it should do it.
* This is often the last testing cycle in the development process.

## User Feedback

* Testers involved in UAT interact with actual users or stakeholders who will be using the software in their day-to-day activities. This unique perspective allows UAT to collect invaluable feedback directly from the end users.
* This feedback can be a gold mine for making adjustments and improvements based on user habits, expectations and preferences.
* Feedback collection and analysis involves specific processes, tools, and techniques such as surveys and user interviews.

### Key Performance Indicators

* `KPIs` help gauge the software's performance and user satisfaction in a more quantitative approach.
* Defect rates, user satisfaction scores, and other performance indicators are used in UATs to measure the testings success.
  > It is important to note that while these metrics can be valuable, KPIs are still only part of the evaluation and do not represent the entire assessment.

### Tools

* User Acceptance Testing tools aim to streamline the UAT testing process and enhance user feedback collection and analysis.
* Tools like [SurveyMonkey][1] and [Google Forms][2] enable the quick collection of structured feedback through **surveys and questionnaires**.
* Tools like [Google Analytics][6] and [Mixpanel][7] are used to measure the aforementioned **KPIs**.
* This feedback is quick and easy to set up but provides limited insight into user experiences.

#### Comprehensive Tools

* Platforms such as [UserTesting][3], [PlaybookUX][4], and [Userlytics][5] allow you to manage comprehensive user tests and facilitate **participant recruitment**, gathering their feedback through videos, surveys, and detailed questionnaires.
* These platforms gather user feedback through videos, surveys, and detailed questionnaires, some even offering features such as **screen recording and user session playback**.
* This feedback gives a deeper understanding of user behavior and allows the team to make decisions based on user experience.
