# What do we understand by "Step" in tablab.io?

* What you are reading is a real example of a Step.
* A learning unit designed to deliver a piece of information and specific knowledge in an easily digestible format.
* It is composed of text in Markdown format that follows a convention of using bulleted lists with short, precise sentences, like this one.
* It can include practical exercises, which are deployed as fresh and isolated docker instances to provide an optimal user experience.

## What is behind this concept?

* This microlearning-oriented approach enables quick absorption of new knowledge without overwhelming the learner with too much information at once.
* It also promotes concentration and can increase the feeling of progress in learning.
* It offers great flexibility and easy reuse of the material, as the content of the same Step, given that it is very specific and concrete, can be convenient in multiple topics.
* It may also be easier to find it useful as a reference for future occasions, especially when seeking to reread a very particular part of a given subject.

## Features to be respected when creating a Step

* The duration of a Step, in terms of the learning process, should be carefully limited to no more than 15 minutes, which ensures that absorption is effective and fits within the time constraints of the learners.
* A Step can function independently as part of one or multiple Labs, offering flexibility in how educational content is structured and delivered.
  * This modularity allows for the combination and customization of Labs to meet different learning needs, enabling the creation of tailored educational pathways that align with each learner's specific goals.
  * This also means that, when creating a Step, even if the initial reason is to include it only in a single Lab, it must have a global and reusable essence.
