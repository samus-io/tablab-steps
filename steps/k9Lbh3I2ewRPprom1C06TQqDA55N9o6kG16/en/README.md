# Continuous Everything in DevOps

* `Continuous Everything` in a DevOps context embodies the philosophy of automating and streamlining every single stage of the software development lifecycle to enable rapid and reliable delivery of high-quality software.

![DevOps Lifecycle: Continuous Everything][1]

## Continuous Integration (CI)

* `Continuous Integration (CI)` is the method frequently merging small code changes from multiple developers into a common repository to maintain code consistency and integration.
* The changes made by developers are verified by creating a build and conducting automated tests against it to ensure quality and functionality.
* Continuous integration strongly focuses on automated testing to ensure that new commits merged into the main branch do not disrupt the application's functionality.

### Requirements

* The team must create automated tests for every new feature, enhancement, or bug fix they develop.
* A continuous integration server is required to monitor the main repository and automatically execute tests for every new commit that is pushed.
* Developers should frequently merge their changes into a central repository, ideally at least once a day.

### Benefits

* Less bugs are released into production because the automated tests catch regressions early on.
* Building the release becomes straightforward since all integration issues have been solved early.
* There is less need for context switching because developers are notified immediately if they break the build, allowing them to fix issues before moving on to other tasks.
* Testing costs are significantly reduced since the CI server can execute hundreds of tests in just a few seconds..
* The QA team spends less time on routine testing, freeing them up to concentrate on major enhancements to the quality culture.

## Continuous Testing (CT)

* `Continuous Testing (CT)` is about running automated tests at every stage of development, as often as possible.
* It involves running automated tests on code integrated during the continuous integration phase. This practice ensures the application's quality and assesses potential risks in the release before it moves on to the delivery pipeline.

### Requirements

* Apart from developing the test scripts, continuous testing involves no manual intervention. However, testers must write these scripts before the coding process starts. Consequently, when code integration occurs, the tests automatically execute in sequence without further human input.

### Benefits

* Enables teams to identify issues and potential risks before the code is deployed to production.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

* `Continuous Delivery (CD)` extends continuous integration by automatically deploying all code changes to a pre-production environment once the build stage is complete.
* This approach not only includes automated testing but also an automated release process, allowing to deploy an application at any time with the simple click of a button.
* With continuous delivery, the team can choose to manually release updates daily, weekly, fortnightly, or at any frequency that best meets the business requirements.

### Requirements

* Having a solid base in continuous integration is crucial, and the test suite should thoroughly cover all parts of the codebase.
* Deployments need to be automated. While the trigger is still manual, once deployment begins, it should proceed without requiring further human intervention.
* It's likely that the team will need to adopt feature flags to ensure that unfinished features don't impact customers in production.

### Benefits

* Encourages developers to release code to production incrementally. This approach simplifies troubleshooting compared to addressing all changes simultaneously.
* Deploying software becomes less complex. The team no longer needs to spend days preparing for a release.
* The company can increase its release frequency, speeding up the feedback loop with customers.
* Less pressure is placed on decisions regarding small changes, which encourages faster iteration.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

* `Continuous Deployment (CD)` makes the reuse of the `CD` abbreviation and it's an advanced version of `Continous Delivery (CD)`.  It surpasses Continuous Delivery by taking an additional step forward in the deployment process.
* Through Continuous Deployment (CD), every change that successfully passes through all stages of the production pipeline is automatically released to customers. Human intervention is not required, and only a failed test will prevent the deployment of a new change to production.
* This approach significantly accelerates the feedback loop with customers and takes pressure off the team by eliminating the need for a designated *release day*. Developers can focus on their work of building software, seeing their changes go live within minutes of completion.

### Requirements

* Maintaining a strong testing culture is essential. The quality of the test suite directly impacts the quality of all releases.
* The documentation process will need to keep up with the pace of deployments.
* Feature flags become integral to the process of releasing significant changes, allowing coordination with other departments such as support and marketing.

### Benefits

* Development can proceed more rapidly since there's no need to pause for releases. Deployments pipelines are automatically triggered for every change, facilitating multiple production deployments within a single day.
* Deploying small batches of changes makes releases less risky and easier to address in case of problems.
* Customers experience a continuous stream of improvements, leading to quality enhancements every day, rather than waiting for monthly, quarterly, or yearly updates.

## Continuous Operations (CO)

* `Continuous Operations (CO)` involves ensuring that software systems are available, reliable, and performant at all times, even during deployment and maintenance activities.
* It refers to those characteristics of a data-processing system that reduce or eliminate the need for planned downtime, such as scheduled maintenance.
* The aim of continuous operations is to efficiently handle both hardware and software changes, ensuring minimal disruption to end users.

### Requirements

* The team will likely need to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC), managing infrastructure configuration and provisioning through code using tools like Terraform, Ansible, or AWS CloudFormation, which enables infrastructure to be version-controlled, reproducible, and easily scalable, reducing the risk of configuration drift and human error.
* The concept of immutable infrastructure will be required, where infrastructure components are treated as disposable and replaced rather than updated or patched in-place. This reduces the risk of configuration changes and ensures consistency across environments.
* Implementing continuous operations in your DevOps pipeline can be costly.
* Applications also need to play a role, as they must be designed with resilience in mind, employing techniques such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing to minimize the impact of failures and ensure high availability.

### Benefits

* Enables maximum availability of apps and environments.
* This approach prevents availability issues and downtime during the release process, ensuring that constant code updates, bug fixes, and patches are transparent to users.

## Continuous Monitoring (CM)

* `Continuous Monitoring (CM)` enables validation of the stability of the environment and whether applications are performing as expected.
* DevOps culture promotes monitoring not just systems, but also applications.
* Key components consist of automated data collection, analysis, reporting, and response, facilitating rapid identification and resolution of security threats and system inefficiencies.

### Requirements

* Implementing continuous monitoring involves following a procedure that includes identifying objectives, selecting appropriate tools, establishing monitoring policies, and integrating with existing systems and processes.
* Robust monitoring tools and dashboards will be essential to track a wide range of metrics across various components of the infrastructure, such as servers, databases, networks, and applications with the goal of facilitating real-time data collection and visualization.
* The team will need to establish automated alerts that promptly notify team members of potential issues or anomalies as they arise. These alerts should be configurable based on thresholds and patterns that hold significance for the business.

### Benefits

* Increased visibility can result in faster and more targeted incident responses, minimizing downtime and service disruption, and ultimately improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Continuous Monitoring provides teams with a wealth of data and insights that can be leveraged to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing trends, patterns, and performance metrics, organizations can optimize their development processes, prioritize improvements, and achieve better outcomes.
* It aids in detecting security threats in real-time and preventing data breaches.
* It can facilitate easy tracking of data security metrics, providing the team with a clear view of the current compliance status and the necessary actions to maintain regulatory compliance.

## Continuous Feedback (CF)

* `Continuous Feedback (CF)` involves evaluating the effect of releases on user experience and reporting the findings to the team tasked with improving future releases.
* Simply delivering applications more quickly doesn't necessarily result in successful business outcomes or increased end-user satisfaction. It's essential to ensure alignment between developers and end users regarding releases and Continuous Feedback is instrumental in achieving this alignment.

### Requirements

* Introduce mechanisms for directly capturing customer feedback, such as user testing, surveys, and usage data analysis. This direct line of insight from end users is crucial for refining products.
* Establish feedback loops that efficiently deliver insights back to the development team. This can involve implementing automated systems for reporting issues and bugs, utilizing user analytics to track behavior and satisfaction, and conducting regular review sessions.
* Provide training to team members emphasizing the significance of feedback, offering guidance on giving and receiving feedback constructively, and instructing on the effective use of feedback tools will be highly demanded.

### Benefits

* Real-time insights acquired from user feedback allows the development team to effectively prioritize tasks, plan new feature implementations, and quickly resolve any issues or bugs.
* End-user feedback provides insight into user experiences, preferences, and pain points and by leveraging this feedback, organizations can adapt their products and services to better meet customer needs, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Feedback empowers teams to identify weaknesses, evaluate their solutions, and refine their processes, which also improves employee engagement.
* Feedback is exchanged smoothly among developers, operations teams, and end-users. Consistent feedback cycles build trust, facilitate the sharing of knowledge, and boost team productivity promoting a culture of collaboration.
