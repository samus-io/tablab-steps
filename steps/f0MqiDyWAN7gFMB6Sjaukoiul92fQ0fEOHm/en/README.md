# General best practices against improper error handling

## Input validation

* Input validation ensures all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent malicious data from causing exceptions.
* Input validation is important because:
  * It prevents attacks like `SQL injection`, `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)`, and `Command injection` by ensuring that only valid and expected data is processed.
  * It ensures that the data stored in the database or processed by the application is accurate and in the correct format.
  * It reduces the likelihood of runtime errors caused by unexpected data types or values.

### Common input validation techniques

#### Built-in methods and libraries

* Using string methods to check and sanitize input.
* Using libraries for more comprehensive validation. For example, use of `validator` or `express-validator`  in Node.js.

#### Regular expressions

* Using regular expressions to validate patterns like email addresses, phone numbers, and more.

#### Schema validation

* Defining and enforcing schemas for input field data structures using libraries.

### Best practices for input validation

* Ensure all data received from users is validated, including query parameters, headers, and body data.
* Always validate data on the server, even if client-side validation is in place.
* Leverage well-maintained libraries for robust validation.
* Use schemas or comprehensive rules to ensure all aspects of the data are validated.

## Use standard error codes

* Standard error codes provide meaningful feedback to users without revealing system details. This approach helps in maintaining security while still informing the user of the error.
* For example, return HTTP status codes like `400` for bad requests, `401` for unauthorized access, and `500` for server errors, instead of detailed error messages.
* It ensures:
  * Consistent error handling across the application.
  * Prevention of sensitive information from being exposed to end users.
  * Easier debugging and logging of errors.
  * Clear and user-friendly error messages.

## Provide generic responses to errors

* Providing generic responses along with response codes to errors is crucial for protecting sensitive information and preventing attackers from gaining insights into the system. Here are multiple types of examples demonstrating how to give generic responses to errors.

### Authentication errors

* Instead of revealing whether a username or password is incorrect, provide a generic error message.
* Instead of a specific error message like `The username doesnâ€™t exis.`, use a generic error message like `We couldn't match your credentials to a valid account`.

### Authorization errors

* Do not disclose specific authorization issues; instead, use a generic message.
* Instead of a specific error message like `You do not have permission to access the admin panel`, use a generic error message like `You are not authorized to perform this action`.

### Resource not found

* Avoid revealing whether a resource exists or not, and use a generic response for missing resources.
* Instead of a specific error message like `Product ID 123 not found`, use a generic error message like `The requested resource could not be found`.

### Database errors

* Prevent exposing database structures or SQL errors by providing a general error message.
* Instead of a specific error message like `SQL Error: syntax error at or near 'DROP TABLE products'`, use a generic error message like `An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again later`.

### Validation errors

* Provide a general response for validation failures without revealing which field caused the error.
* Instead of showing a technical error like `Input does not match pattern [a-z]{1,15}`, provide a clear and user-friendly message like `Username must be alphanumeric and between 1 to 15 characters long`.

### File upload errors

* Avoid disclosing details about file paths or server configurations when an error occurs during file upload.
* Instead of a specific error message like `File upload failed: /var/www/uploads/tmp/file.txt not found`, use a generic error message like `File upload failed. Please try again`.

### Server errors

* Do not reveal internal server issues or stack traces to the user.
* Instead of a specific error message like `NullPointerException at line 45 in Main.java`, use a generic error message like `An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later`.

### Rate limiting

* Provide a general message when rate limiting is applied, without revealing specific thresholds or limits.
* Instead of a specific error message like `You have exceeded the rate limit of 100 requests per minute`, use a generic error message like `Too many requests. Please try again later`.

### Form submission errors

* Generalize error messages for form submissions to avoid revealing which field caused the issue.
* Instead of a specific error message like `The 'age' field must be a number`, use a generic error message like `There was an error with your submission. Please check your input and try again`.

### Payment errors

* Provide a generic message for payment processing errors to avoid revealing details about the failure.
* Instead of a specific error message like `Payment failed due to insufficient funds`, use a generic error message like `Payment could not be processed. Please check your payment details and try again`.

## Implement robust error handling

* Catch exceptions at various points in the application to prevent crashes and unintended behavior.
* For example, use try-except blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.

### Key practices for robust error handling

#### Catch and handle all errors

* Use `try-catch` blocks for exception handling in synchronous code.
* Use middleware for handling errors globally.
* Ensure the application can continue to function or degrade gracefully in the event of an error.
* For example, display a maintenance page or fallback content if a critical error occurs.

#### Use asynchronous error handling

* Ensure that asynchronous operations have proper error handling. For example, use `async/await` with `try-catch` blocks in Node.js.
* Asynchronous error handling involves managing errors that occur in code executed asynchronously, such as operations involving `callbacks`, `Promise`, or the `async/await` syntax.
* Using `try-catch` blocks in asynchronous functions is like putting a safety net around the risky parts of the code. This prevents errors from causing the entire program to crash.

#### Actively log meaningful error messages

* Log errors to a secure location without exposing them to users. Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information.
* For example, use logging libraries to store error logs securely and monitor them regularly.

#### Centralize error handling

* Centralize error handling ensures consistent error handling and responses, improving the overall user experience.
* Facilitates easier debugging and logging of errors, making it simpler to identify and fix issues.
* Error handling middleware provide a single, dedicated mechanism or set of functions responsible for catching and managing errors throughout the application.
* Use middleware to catch errors and respond appropriately. Ensure that errors do not propagate without being caught.

#### Use default values

* Use default values and fallbacks to ensure the code can handle missing data.

## Implement unit tests for error handling

* Write unit tests to check for proper error handling and ensure sensitive information is not leaked. Unit test helps the developers to simulate different error scenarios.
* For example, test scenarios with invalid inputs, nonexistent resources, and simulated exceptions.
* Ensure that all potential error scenarios are covered in tests.
* Regularly review test results to identify and fix any issues with error handling.
