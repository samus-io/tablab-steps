# Best practices to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities

* Preventing Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) requires robust access control mechanisms and secure coding practices throughout the application.
* While enforcing proper access control is the cornerstone of mitigating IDOR risks, several additional best practices can help eliminate scenarios where these vulnerabilities might arise.

## Perform input validation

* Input validation acts as the first line of defense by ensuring that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
* By validating parameters early, malicious or malformed requests can be rejected, preventing exploitation of unintended behaviors.
* Input validation ensures that all incoming data meets predefined criteria before proceeding with the application's logic. For instance:
  * Check that numeric parameters are indeed numbers and within an acceptable range.
  * Verify that string inputs do not contain unexpected characters or exceed length restrictions.
* By validating inputs early, malicious requests can be promptly rejected, returning a generic error message to avoid exposing internal logic or details.

## Enforce access control

* Access control is the most effective measure to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities. Ensure that every request is checked against the user's permissions before accessing or modifying any resource.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define granular permissions for each user role.
* Design backend logic to verify the ownership or permission level of the requesting user for every resource they attempt to access.

## Least privilege principle

* The least privilege principle is a fundamental security concept that ensures users, applications, and systems have access only to the resources and permissions necessary to perform their specific tasks.
* By limiting access rights, the principle reduces the attack surface and minimizes the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.
* Ensure users only have access to the minimum set of resources necessary for their role.

## Avoid direct object references

* Exposing sensitive identifiers in URLs or POST bodies can make it easier for attackers to manipulate them and exploit vulnerabilities like IDOR. Whenever possible, applications should minimize the exposure of such identifiers and rely on alternative methods to determine user context.
* Instead of including identifiers in user-controlled inputs (e.g., query parameters or POST bodies), rely on session data stored securely on the server to determine the identity of the currently authenticated user.
* For example, use the session token or cookie to retrieve the user's context directly from the server-side session store.

## Usage of UUIDs or random identifiers

* Using complex and randomly generated identifiers instead of sequential numeric ones provides an additional layer of security by reducing the risk of attackers predicting or manipulating them.
* Unlike numeric IDs (e.g., 1, 2, 3), which are sequential and easy to guess, UUIDs or random strings are much harder for attackers to predict.
* This practice does not replace access control but helps mitigate the risk of exploitation when identifiers are exposed.
