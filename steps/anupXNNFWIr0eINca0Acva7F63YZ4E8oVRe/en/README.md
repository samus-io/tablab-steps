# Best practices to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities

* Preventing `Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)` involves utilizing the defense-in-depth principle alongside enforcing robust access control measures.

## Security measures checklist

* [ ] Perform input validation to confirm that data from users adheres to the expected formats and constraints.
* [ ] Enforce access control checks for every object or data users attempt to access, using the recommended structural approach for the chosen web framework.
* [ ] Use UUIDs or equivalent long random values for primary keys to significantly reduce the likelihood of attackers guessing valid entries. If necessary, introduce a column containing random strings to replace or enhance numeric identifiers in the database table.
* [ ] Minimize the exposure of identifiers in URLs and POST bodies by determining the authenticated user through session data.
* [ ] Restrict object lookups by primary keys to datasets that are accessible to the user.

## Perform input validation

* Input validation acts as the first line of defense by ensuring that user-supplied data aligns with predefined criteria before it's processed or stored.
* Validating parameters early ensures malicious or malformed requests are rejected, preventing exploitation of unintended behaviors while supporting non-descriptive error messages to avoid exposing internal logic or details.

## Enforce access control

* Implementing access control is the most reliable way to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities, ensuring that each request is verified against user permissions before accessing or altering resources.
* This involves structuring backend logic to validate the permission level of the requesting user for each resource they try to access, utilizing common strategies such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), or Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

### Principle of least privilege

* The `Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)` is a fundamental security concept that ensures users, applications, and systems have access only to the resources and permissions necessary to perform their specific tasks.
* Limiting access rights reduces the attack surface and minimizes the potential impact of existing security vulnerabilities.

## Avoid direct object references

* Exposing sensitive identifiers in URLs or POST bodies can make it easier for attackers to manipulate them and exploit IDOR vulnerabilities. Whenever possible, applications should minimize the exposure of such identifiers and rely on alternative methods to determine user context.
* Rather than including identifiers in user-controlled inputs like query parameters or POST bodies, use session data stored securely on the server to determine the authenticated user's identity, leveraging the session token or cookie to access their context directly from the session store.

## Employ randomly generated identifiers

* The adoption of UUIDs or randomly generated strings decreases the chances of attackers successfully guessing identifiers, providing a notable security benefit compared to sequential numeric IDs.
* This approach does not act as a replacement for access control but complements it by reducing the exploitation risks linked to exposed identifiers.
* Encryption of identifiers is discouraged because maintaining secure encryption practices can be challenging.
