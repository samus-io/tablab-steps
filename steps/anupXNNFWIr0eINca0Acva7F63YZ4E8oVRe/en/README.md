# Best practices to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities

* Preventing Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) requires robust access control mechanisms and secure coding practices throughout the application.
* While enforcing proper access control is the cornerstone of mitigating IDOR risks, several additional best practices can help eliminate scenarios where these vulnerabilities might arise.

## Perform input validation

* Input validation acts as the first line of defense by ensuring that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
* Input validation ensures that data entering the application meets strict criteria before proceeding to the application's logic.
* By validating parameters early, malicious or malformed requests can be rejected, preventing exploitation of unintended behaviors.
* An example of input validation could be when the web application receives as a parameter an id that should be a positive number.
* Before continuing with the logic of the application, you must check that the value of the parameter is a positive numeric value and if it is not, return a generic error to the user.

## Enforce access control

* Access control is the most effective measure to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities. Ensure that every request is checked against the user's permissions before accessing or modifying any resource.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to define granular permissions for each user role.
* Design backend logic to verify the ownership or permission level of the requesting user for every resource they attempt to access.

## Avoid exposing identifiers

* Exposing sensitive identifiers in URLs or POST bodies can make it easier for attackers to manipulate them and exploit vulnerabilities like IDOR. Whenever possible, applications should minimize the exposure of such identifiers and rely on alternative methods to determine user context.
* Instead of including identifiers in user-controlled inputs (e.g., query parameters or POST bodies), rely on session data stored securely on the server to determine the identity of the currently authenticated user.
* For example, use the session token or cookie to retrieve the user's context directly from the server-side session store.

## Usage of UUIDs or random identifiers

* Replacing simple, enumerable numeric identifiers with complex, unpredictable identifiers provides an additional layer of security.
* Unlike numeric IDs (e.g., 1, 2, 3), which are sequential and easy to guess, UUIDs or random strings are much harder for attackers to predict.
* This practice does not replace access control but helps mitigate the risk of exploitation when identifiers are exposed.
