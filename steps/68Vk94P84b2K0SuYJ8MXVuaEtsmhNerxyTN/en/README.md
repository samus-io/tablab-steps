# Information disclosure via HTTP methods

* HTTP methods allow interaction with web resources, but some can unintentionally leak sensitive information if not properly restricted.
* Disabling or restricting unnecessary methods helps reduce the attack surface of a web application.

## Insecure HTTP methods that may expose sensitive data

### TRACE

* The `TRACE` method is primarily used for diagnostic purposes. When a web server receives an HTTP `TRACE` request and supports this method, it returns the exact request it received, including all HTTP headers. This allows clients to see what data is being sent to the server.
* However, if this method is enabled, it can pose a security risk. For example, an attacker might exploit a vulnerability like `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)` to run malicious code in a user's browser. That code could silently send a `TRACE` request to a server and read the response. Since the response includes all original headers, the attacker might gain access to sensitive information such as cookies or authentication tokens.
* Here's an example of how the `TRACE` method works using `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -i -X TRACE http://example.tbl/
  ```

* If the server supports the `TRACE` method, the response might look like this:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT
  Content-Type: text/html
  Content-Length: 259

  TRACE / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.tbl
  Cookie: sessionid=1234; HttpOnly
  User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
  Accept: */*
  ```

### TRACK

* `TRACK` works similarly to `TRACE` by reflecting the received request in the response.
* Although not commonly enabled, if active, it can be exploited to leak headers data in the same way as `TRACE`.
* Its use is outdated and generally considered insecure.
* A request using the `TRACK` method can be done using `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -i -X TRACK http://example.tbl/
  ```

* If enabled, the server could respond as follows:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT
  Content-Type: text/html
  Content-Length: 259

  TRACK / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.tbl
  Cookie: sessionid=1234; HttpOnly
  User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
  Accept: */*
  ```

### DEBUG

* The `DEBUG` method is designed for debugging and is rarely used in production setups.
* If enabled, it might expose internal server details or allow command execution depending on the server configuration.
* This method poses a high risk and should not be available on public-facing systems.
* In certain misconfigured environments, the `DEBUG` method may be enabled. The following curl command demonstrates how it might be used:

  ```bash
  curl -i -X DEBUG http://example.tbl/
  ```

* If accepted, the server could return internal diagnostic data such as:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 12:10:00 GMT
  Content-Type: text/plain
  Content-Length: 512

  --- DEBUG INFO ---
  Request start time: 2025-05-07T12:10:00Z
  Application root: /var/www/html/app
  Loaded modules: auth, db_connector, cache
  Database connection string: Server=db.example.tbl;Database=prod;User Id=...
  Stack trace:
  at Database.Connect()
  at Api.HandleRequest()
  â€¦
  ```

### OPTIONS

* The `OPTIONS` method returns information about which HTTP methods are supported by the server for a given resource.
* While it does not directly expose data, it can help attackers map out potential methods to target.
* In some frameworks or API configurations, it may also return metadata or documentation that was not meant to be exposed.
* Limiting or customizing its response can reduce unintended information disclosure.
* The following `curl` command demonstrates how to retrieve the supported HTTP methods for a given endpoint using the `OPTIONS` method:

  ```bash
  curl -i -X OPTIONS http://example.tbl/api/users
  ```

* If the server supports this method, it may respond with metadata about the endpoint:

  ```bash
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 07 May 2025 12:15:00 GMT
  Allow: GET, POST, OPTIONS
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 198

  {
    "methods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
    "apiVersion": "v1.2.3",
    "parameters": [
        {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "description": "Unique resource identifier"
        },
        {
        "name": "verbose",
        "type": "boolean",
        "required": false,
        "description": "Include detailed logs in response"
        }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Recommended security approaches

### Restrict unnecessary HTTP methods

* Web servers and applications should be configured to allow only the HTTP methods that are strictly required.
* Disabling unused or potentially dangerous methods reduces the risk of information leakage and abuse.

  * In Apache, the following configuration can be used to allow only `GET` and `POST`, denying all other methods:

  ```apache
  <Location />
      <LimitExcept GET POST>
          Require all denied
      </LimitExcept>
  </Location>
  ```

  * In IIS, HTTP methods can be restricted by configuring the `web.config` file. This helps prevent the use of unsafe or unnecessary methods, reducing the potential attack surface.
  * The following example allows only `GET` and `POST` methods, while explicitly denying all others:

  ```xml
  <configuration>
    <system.webServer>
      <security>
        <requestFiltering>
          <verbs>
            <add verb="GET" allowed="true"/>
            <add verb="POST" allowed="true"/>
            <add verb="*" allowed="false"/>
          </verbs>
        </requestFiltering>
      </security>
    </system.webServer>
  </configuration>
  ```

  * In Nginx, HTTP methods can be restricted using conditional rules inside the server or location block.
  * The following configuration allows only `GET` and `POST` methods, rejecting all others:

  ```nginx
  server {
      location / {
          if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|POST)$) {
              return 405;
          }

          # Other configuration
      }
  }
