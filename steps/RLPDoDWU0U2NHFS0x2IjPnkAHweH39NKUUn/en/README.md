# What is the information disclosure?

* The `Information Disclosure` is a security vulnerability in web applications that exposes sensitive or confidential information to users who should not have access to it.
* This can include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as usernames, email addresses, and identification numbers, as well as technical details like server versions, source code, internal IP addresses, and more.
* Minimizing the exposure of technical information in web applications is essential for security. Preventing access to this data helps block attackers from discovering vulnerabilities in outdated components and understanding the application’s architecture, reducing the chances of successful attacks.
  * Additionally, limiting exposed information decreases the attack surface, making it harder for attackers to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
* In essence, restricting access to sensitive information strengthens the application's defenses against intrusion attempts.

## Common examples of information disclosure

* The most common examples of information disclosure in web applications  include:
  * Source code exposure through version control systems.
  * Disclosing server details in HTTP response headers.
  * Including users' personal information in GET request URLs, such as ID numbers or email addresses.
  * Displaying details about the technologies used by the application in error pages.

## What is the impact of information disclosure?

* The impact of information disclosure can be broad and varies significantly depending on the type of data exposed:
  * When the **web application source code** is exposed allows attackers to analyze the application's logic, increasing the chances of discovering new vulnerabilities.
  * **User privacy risks** arise when personal data is leaked, potentially leading to identity theft and fraud.
  * **Application security risks** occur when technical details are revealed, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise system integrity.
  * **Legal and reputational consequences** may follow due to poor information management, resulting in legal penalties, financial losses, and damage to an organization’s reputation.
